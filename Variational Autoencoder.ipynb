        "Recall that Variational Autoencoder is a probabilistic model of data based on a continious mixture of distributions. In the lecture we covered the mixture of gaussians case, but here we will apply VAE to binary MNIST images (each pixel is either black or white). To better model binary data we will use a continuous mixture of binomial distributions: $p(x \\mid w) = \\int p(x \\mid t, w) p(t) dt$, where the prior distribution on the latent code $t$ is standard normal $p(t) = \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$, but probability that $(i, j)$-th pixel is black equals to $(i, j)$-th output of the decoder neural detwork: $p(x_{i, j} \\mid t, w) = \\text{decoder}(t, w)_{i, j}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To train this model we would like to maximize marginal log-likelihood of our dataset $\\max_w \\log p(X \\mid w)$, but it's very hard to do computationally, so instead we maximize the Variational Lower Bound w.r.t. both the original parameters $w$ and variational distribution $q$ which we define as encoder neural network with parameters $\\phi$ which takes input image $x$ and outputs parameters of the gaussian distribution $q(t \\mid x, \\phi)$: $\\log p(X \\mid w) \\geq \\mathcal{L}(w, \\phi) \\rightarrow \\max_{w, \\phi}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "So overall our model looks as follows: encoder takes an image $x$, produces a distribution over latent codes $q(t \\mid x)$ which should approximate the posterior distribution $p(t \\mid x)$ (at least after training), samples a point from this distribution $\\widehat{t} \\sim q(t \\mid x, \\phi)$, and finally feeds it into a decoder that outputs a distribution over images.\n",

        "In the lecture, we also discussed that variational lower bound has an expected value inside which we are going to approximate with sampling. But it is not trivial since we need to differentiate through this approximation. However, we learned about _reparametrization trick_ which suggests instead of sampling from distribution $\\widehat{t} \\sim q(t \\mid x, \\phi)$ sample from a distribution which doesn't depend on any parameters, e.g. standard normal, and then deterministically transform this sample to the desired one: $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I); ~~\\widehat{t} = m(x, \\phi) + \\varepsilon \\sigma(x, \\phi)$. This way we don't have to worry about our stochastic gradient being biased and can straightforwardly differentiate our loss w.r.t. all the parameters while treating the current sample $\\varepsilon$ as constant.\n",

People usually optimize this normalized version of VLB since it doesn't depend on the dataset set - you can write VLB function once and use it for different datasets - the dataset size won't affect the learning rate too much. The correct value for this normalized negated VLB should be around $100 - 170$ in the example below."
